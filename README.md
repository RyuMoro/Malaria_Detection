# Malaria_Detection

This is the final data science project for the "Applied Data Science Program" (MIT Professional Education).

The objective was to correctly identify parasitized cell images and uninfected cell images.<br>
The final model (a fine-tuned model of EfficientNetV2B3) has shown a high accuracy (98%) and a high F1 score (98%).<br>
